# Eyes Exercise

## Exercise:
It allows to perform an interactive activity, as two eyes shown in a website can be animated moving the mouse around them.

## How to run it:
You just need to move your mouse  around the eyes. The pupils of the eyes would move to the direccion of your mouse.

## Roadmap of future improvements:
It would be nice to be able to show other parts of a face (such as a mouth) and move them with the mouse too.

This excersice and its coding is linked to a MIT license.
